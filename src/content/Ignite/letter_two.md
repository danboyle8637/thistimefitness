Hi. I’m Kindal.

I own This Time Fitness.

A strength training and healthy living studio for women.

Getting started is the most important first step. But coming to a studio can be scary.

That’s why I created Ignite.

Ignite is a 6 week fast start challenge to help you build the right initial exercise habits… nutrition habits… and mental habits to melt fat and get your first big win.

Maybe that’s losing 12 pounds… dropping two clothes sizes… or doing 8 straight pushups…

Ignite gives you the weekly plan to succeed and build momentum.
