Kara has always been an athletic woman. Strong... fast... and coordinated.

But she found TTF was able to challenge her like no other gym or studio in town. AND... during the last challenge, she really stepped things up.

Of course she did amazing with her fitness... but this time she focused on the nutrition changes outside of class.

She was able to lose weight... get a lot stronger... and she did her fist pullup. Now she's doing multiple pullups.

Kara is proof that there's always a next level to chase. I can't wait to see what she does during this Summer Challenge.

If Kara can level her body up... so can you.

Join the Summer Slim Down Challenge... meet Kara and workout with her... and make your own transformation.
