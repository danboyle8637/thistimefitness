These ladies work hard and it shows!

They are best friends and joined our last challenge together. The idea was to hold each other accountable.

It worked! Both lost just over 8 pounds... several inches... and they are stronger than they've ever been.

Cara suffered from a very weak core due to breast cancer surgery. She could barely hold a plank without stopping.

Now she's strong and feeling incredible.

If Cara and Barb can kick butt and stay consistent... you can to.

Join the Summer Slim Down Challenge... meet both of these amazing ladies... and make your own transformation.
