Obviously exercise has some inherent risks of injury.

So, if you're new to exercise and you're unsure about whether strength training is right for you... consult your doctor and make sure you know your specific risks.

When you come to our studio, you will see and sign our full disclaimer form.

You will accknowledge these risks and take them upon yourself.

Of course we will do everything in our ability to protect you and put you in the right positions... the right level of intensity... and the right confidence to excel during every single class.

To read our detailed disclaimer, come in for our [14 day trial for only \$14]('../../pages/14-for-14-new-member-special.js') or if it's right for you... try our [Ignite Beginner Program]('../../pages/ignite.js').
