Hi. I’m Kindal.

I own This Time Fitness.

A strength training and healthy living studio for women.

Getting started is the most important first step. But coming to a studio can be scary.

That’s why we're doing Fall Into Fitness.

This is a 6 week challenge to help you build the right exercise habits... nutrition habits... and mental habits to melt fat and get your first big win.

Maybe that’s losing 12 pounds... dropping two clothing sizes... or doing 8 straight pushups...

Fall Into Fitness gives you the weekly plans to succeed and build momentum.
