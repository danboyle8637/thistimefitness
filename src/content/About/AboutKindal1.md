I founded This Time Fitness as a small women’s only boot camp in 2009.

I used to be 32 pounds overweight. I struggled for years trying to lose weight and be healthy.

It wasn’t until I was introduced to strength training that everything changed for me.

Since then, I have become a student of strength and functional training for women.
