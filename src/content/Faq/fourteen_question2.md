question: 'Why do I have to pay $14... other gyms have free trials?'
---

We don’t offer free trials for two reasons…

1. Most women who sign up for a free trial never show up and this causes massive administration issues for us.

2. We have a limited membership and want to attract women who are serious about taking action and making the changes necessary to transform their body and life.

The choice is yours.
