question: Do you have childcare?
---

We don't have childcare.

Yet, we have members bring their children to the studio so they don't have to miss classes.

You can do this too. Just let us know so we can be prepared. It's not something we like to make a habit... because most women come here to get away from their daily lives... it's precious ME time.
