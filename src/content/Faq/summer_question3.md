question: I have a previous injury/pain... will I be able to do the workouts?

Yes! This is what makes us so unique compared to anyplace else in Charleston.

We train you during class. So we can modify the workout to match your needs... even if that means completely changing exercises.

We have helped dozens of women with injuries not only fix them... but successfully work around them.
