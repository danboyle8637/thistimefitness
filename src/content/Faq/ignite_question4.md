question: 'What should I bring to class?'
---

Bring a water bottle. We have water foutains... but it's easier to fill up and bring your water bottle around the room as you workout.

Bring a towel. You will sweat a lot and it helps to wipe if off.

Bring a yoga mat if you have one. We have mats for you, but if you would rather not use a mat somebody else touched... bring your own.

Bring a positive attitude. You will be challenged. Being excited, determinded, and energized will make ALL the difference. Come ready to have fun and kick some butt.
