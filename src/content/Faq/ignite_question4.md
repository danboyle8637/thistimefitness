question: 'What should I bring to class?'
---

Bring a water bottle. We have foutains for you... but it's easier to fill them up and bring your water bottle around the room as you workout.

Bring a towel. You will sweat a lot and it helps to have something you can wipe yourself off with.

Bring a yoga mat if you have one. We have mats for you, but if you would rather not use a mat somebody else has touched... bring your own.

Bring a positive attitude. You will be challenged and being excited, determinded, and energized will make ALL the difference. Come ready to have fun and kick some butt to your level of fitness.
