question: What do I need to bring to my 1st workout?
---

Bring a water bottle. We have a foutain you can use, but bring a bottle so you can carry it around with you.

Bring a small towel to wipe up sweat from your face. You're going to sweat... and this helps a lot.

We have yoga mats for you, but if you want your own... bring that.

Finally, a good attitude. The more excited you are... the better your workouts and results will be.
