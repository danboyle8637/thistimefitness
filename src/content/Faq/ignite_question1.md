question: 'How much does it cost to join the Fall Into Fitness program?'
---

Fall Into Fitness is a special group of women who go through a 6 weeks period together. If you join Fall Into Fitness, you’re only obligated to the 6 weeks of the program.

The cost is the same as our normal membership since you’ll attend normal classes. The two most popular plans cost $127 per month and $155 per month.

- \$87 gives you 8 classes per month.
- \$127 gives you 12 classes per month.
- \$155 gives you unlimited classes per month.

After Fall Into Fitness, if you want to stay a member, sign up for our normal membership options which are all month to month.
