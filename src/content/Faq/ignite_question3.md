question: 'Is Fall Into Fitness a separate workout class?'
---

No. You'll attend the same classes as the rest of our members.

Don't worry though. You'll receive a HIGH level of one-on-one attention during class.

Fall Into Fitness is a separate group of women. You'll have private access to an Fall Into Fitness Facebook Group and special training directly from me.

Once a month, we'll do a special Saturday workshop for Fall Into Fitness members only where we'll go over form... positions... and mobility... and cement the ideas you've been learning during your classes.
