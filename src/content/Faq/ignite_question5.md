question: 'Do I need to arrive early to my first class?'

No. You don't need to arrive extra early for your first class.

I would recommend arriving 5 minutes early so when the class before ends... you're ready to immediately start.

You'll get all the personal attention you can handle during your first class... so don't worry about that!
