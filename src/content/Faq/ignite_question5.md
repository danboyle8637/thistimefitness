question: 'Do I need to arrive early to my first class?'

No. You don't need to arrive especially early for your first class.

I would recommend arriving 5 minutes early so when the class before yours ends... you're ready to immediately start.

You will get all the personal attention you can handle during your first class... so don't worry about that!
